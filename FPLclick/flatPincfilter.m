function h = flatPincfilter(calib, card2volts, nfilt)
% Function to generate a filter to provide a flat FPL in the ear
% that was just calibrated. If phase doesn't matter for you, you can apply
% this with filtfilt. This has an additional delay of nfilt/2 samples.
%
% INPUTS:
%   calib - The structure from ear calibration
%   card2volts - The scaling between MATLAB values and D/A voltage
%   nfilt - filter length
%
% RETURNS:
%   h - filter which will yield a 1 Pa RMS FPL for matlab RMS 1 white noise
%       (the filter itself will give a 1 Pa pe-FPL click)
% Important Note:
%   (1) If you only care about flatness in a certain frequency range,
%   make Pfor = 1 for all other frequencies before using this function.
%   (2) The probe mic calibration, including phase is important for this
%   to work well for transient sounds
